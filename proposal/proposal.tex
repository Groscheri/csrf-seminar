  % TODO abstract/resume of the seminar
  \csrf{} (CSRF) -- often spelled ``sea surf'' -- is a well-known web attack which has 
  been discovered in 2001. The \textit{Open Web Application Security Project} (OWASP \cite{owasp}) 
  ranked CSRF as the 8th vulnerabily in the top 10 of the most critical web application 
  security risks in 2013~\cite{owasp_top_ten}.

  % What are the limitations? What will you NOT do?
  
  The goal of this seminar is to get deeper understanding on the CSRF attack. We believe 
  that a theoretical part associated with practical examples is mandatory in order to fully understand 
  where this vulnerability comes from and how to prevent it. That's why we will focus our attention 
  on the implementation of a small web server delivering vulnerable and none vulnerable 
  services (from CSRF attack). This practical part must be short enough in order to, in a second part, focus our 
  attention on 2 Google attacks due to CSRF vulnerability. We will cover the specificities 
  of both attacks and we will see the differences and the impacts of those two security 
  breaches.
  
  \subsection{Seminar plan}
  % plan
  
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item CSRF: how it works ?
   \item CSRF: how to prevent it ?
   \item Some stories about CSRF
   \begin{itemize}
    \item Google: 2 vulnerabilities in 2007 (contact list spoofing \& email filter hijacking)
    \item Other important attacks [TODO] % TODO
   \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \subsection{Practical part}
  
  % TODO
  
  \subsection{Limitations}

  In this seminar, we won't study browser mechanisms which allow or prevent cross-origin 
  request (XHR request from JavaScript for instance). Moreover, we won't go deep in HTTP 
  protocol~\cite{rfc2616} and we will focus our attention on GET and POST methods only~\cite[5.1.1]{rfc2616}.
